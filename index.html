      <p>
        Skiing is our family's elixir to a great life in the winter.  It allows us to breathe fresh air, excercise outdoors and spend quality family time together.  We've even been known to do a little math instruction while riding the lift.

    <h2> Founders</h2>
      <p>
        The founders of the Smith family as noted above are Jim and Tina.  They were married in Phoenix, AZ in Sept. 2001 at the Columbia Church in front of God, friends and family.  It is with this strong <strong>tradition of love and faith in each other</strong> that Jim and Tina have set forth to make the best family possible.  With two great kids, Esther and Lincoln, they are continuing this tradition and are thought of founding members of the Smith clan.
